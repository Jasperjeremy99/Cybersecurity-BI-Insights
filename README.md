# Cybersecurity-Analytics-BI-Dashboards

This repository contains the documentation for a Business Intelligence (BI) project focused on creating insightful Power BI dashboards for cybersecurity analytics. The dashboards are designed to assist various global and national agencies in combating cybercrime and terrorism by providing visual insights into cyberattack incidents, attackers, and victims.

## Project Goal

The primary goal was to develop interactive dashboards that translate complex cybersecurity data into actionable intelligence for different stakeholders, enabling informed decision-making in threat response, counterterrorism efforts, and victim support.

## Files Overview

* **`cybersecurity_dashboards_report.docx`**: This Word document serves as a comprehensive report detailing the design, objectives, and insights derived from three distinct Power BI dashboards:
    * **Dashboard 1 (INTERPOL)**: Focuses on identifying and tracking uncaught attackers, providing details on their identities, attack dates, locations, and offense counts.
    * **Dashboard 2 (UN Counterterrorism Centre)**: Profiles terror groups, including member counts, arrests, casualties, and threat levels, to guide dismantling efforts.
    * **Dashboard 3 (Australian Re-insurance Pool Corporation - ARPC)**: Assesses victim impact, including financial losses, recovery efforts, outstanding debt, and liquidation risk, to aid insurance and recovery planning.

## Key Insights & Features from Dashboards

* **Attacker Profiling**: Visual identification of key attacker attributes to support law enforcement efforts.
* **Organizational Threat Assessment**: Insights into groups involved in attacks, their global presence, and impact on victims.
* **Victim Impact Analysis**: Detailed financial and operational impact assessment for affected companies, aiding in risk mitigation and recovery strategies.
* **Strategic Recommendations**: The report includes business recommendations derived from dashboard insights, such as improving fraud detection, securing government funds for casualties, and ensuring major companies are ARPC customers.

## Technologies Used

* Power BI (for dashboard creation and visualization)
* Microsoft Word (for documentation and report generation)

<!--## Future Enhancements (Optional)

* (To be added if you find them): Actual Power BI `.pbix` files for interactive exploration.
* (To be added if you find them): Underlying datasets (e.g., Master Table, Attackers List, Proprietors List) used to populate the dashboards.
